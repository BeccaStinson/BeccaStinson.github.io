Hello! I'm Rebecca Stinson and I am a second year PhD student in Biomedical Engineering at Case Western Reserve University. My current research area of interest is on using wearable technologies and machine learning to better understand motor symptoms in Parkinsons Disease. 

On the rest of the website you'll find information about myself and my past work, along with some info on what I'm working on right now.
