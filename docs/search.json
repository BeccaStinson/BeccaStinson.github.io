    "text": "Orthostatic Hypotension in Parkinsons Disease\nOrthostatic hypotension is estimated to affect 30-40% of individuals living with Parkinsons Disease. Within those individuals, 2/3rds are asymptomatic, meaning they don’t report any feelings of lightheadedness or dizziness upon standing. Despite this, asymptomatic OH has been shown to have similar levels of cognitive and physical impairment to symptomatic OH, and individuals show an increased risk of unexplained falls. In my future research, I aim to develop new technologies for easily and reliably identifying individuals with Parkinsons Disease that are experiencing orthostatic hypotension."

    "text": "Hey thanks for reading this far! A major part of my life is dealing with a chronic illness and part of my mission as a researcher is to help spread awareness for dysautonomia. When I was in 7th grade I became sick with the flu and never really recovered. A few years later I was diagnosed with a condition called POTS (Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome) a form of dysautonomia. Dysautonomia is an umbrella term for conditions affecting the autonomic nervous system. In the case of POTS, this manifests as fast heart rate when standing up. Everyone with POTS has different experiences, but for me it contributes to excessive fatigue, headaches, dizziness, temperature dysregulation, amongst a host of other symptoms.\nPOTS is significantly under researched and unfortunately there are currently no FDA approved medications to help manage the symptoms of POTS. I was fortunate to be able to advocate on capital hill as part of Dysautonomia International’s Advocacy Day in 2023.\nIf you are at all interested in learning more about POTS or the research that needs to be done, please check out the links I have included below.\nDysautonomia International: https://www.dysautonomiainternational.org/\nNIH NOSI: https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-HL-24-018.html"

    "text": "Recently, I have been planning the writing and publishing of my first scientific paper. As part of this process, decisions have to be made as to how much to share and what kind of access to provide. The book How to be a Modern Scientist by Jeffrey Leek touches on these decisions and stresses the importance of sharing papers as freely as possible. Leek also notes that along with the published paper, researchers should also make their data and code available and directly linked to in any published articles. This allows for better scrutiny on the reproducibility of research, as well as new analysis of data.\nRepositories should contain raw data and all of the necessary code so that an outside individual could reproduce the results presented. Along with the raw data should be a description of the data and its format. Any code generated during the processing or analysis of the data should be clearly annotated so others can quickly understand its function. This particularly has been a point of frustration for myself, both as the one annotating and as the one trying to understand someone else’s code. Everyone tends to have their own style while writing code, for instance their particular format for variable naming. Proper and complete documentation can be crucial when implementing code written by someone else, especially as the code itself becomes more complex.\nMy main takeaway has been that not only is it important to share our scientific findings and data with the world, it is also important to provide the necessary documentation to make reproducing those findings possible.\nIf you’re interested in reading more: How to be a Modern Scientist can be purchased at http://leanpub.com/modernscientist."
